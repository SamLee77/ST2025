# This is your introduction page

**This list is not in order**

- Add purpose of software
- Add purpose of your specific instruction pages
- Add intended user and level of user: terms like beginner or intermediate are vague: what can a beginner do? What can an intermdiate do and what do they already know?
- Add admonitions and show what they will be used for
- Add conventions: **bold** is for eactions, for example
- add prerequisities; "you should already have x installed"
